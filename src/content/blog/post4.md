# Closing a Chapter, Opening a New One ðŸš€

Today marks my last day as an **AI Software Engineer** at **Solico Group**, where I had the incredible opportunity to contribute to an exciting new **startup initiative â€” Zhinto**.  

During my time here, I worked on a variety of challenging and impactful projects that pushed the boundaries of applied AI in real-world systems. Some highlights from my journey include:

- **Developed a fully concurrent RAG pipeline** integrating state-of-the-art chunking and retrieval strategies with a vector database â€” boosting retrieval speed by 80%.
- **Built and deployed a production-grade API** using FastAPI for seamless chatbot integration and scalability.
- **Created multilingual data pipelines** to fine-tune embedding models, reducing embedder warm-up time to under 1 second on a single A100 GPU.
- **Fine-tuned and pruned a distilled LLM**, deploying it with 5 RPS sustained throughput on a single A100 GPU for B2B applications.
- **Developed LLM-powered AI agents** for e-commerce:
  - Automating SKU addition/omission in shopping baskets based on chat prompts.
  - Detecting client intent and recommending SKUs to increase purchase likelihood.
- **Led a team to fine-tune a vision-language model for OCR** of handwritten and printed invoices, enabling automatic SKU extraction and integration into chatbot workflows.
- **Contributed to voice-to-text and text-to-voice model development** by creating data monitoring systems and improving fine-tuning pipelines.

These experiences not only sharpened my engineering skills but also deepened my appreciation for the intersection of **AI research**, **product development**, and **scalable deployment**.

## Whatâ€™s Next ðŸŒŸ

Iâ€™m excited to share that Iâ€™ll be joining the **Department of Artificial Intelligence and Data Science at Monash University** as an **AI Researcher** in a Ph.D. Program.  

This new chapter represents an incredible opportunity to dive deeper into neuro-symbolic, machine learning and how to combine them to make more reliable AI Agents
