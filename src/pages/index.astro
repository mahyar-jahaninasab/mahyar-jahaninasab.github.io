        Recognized (to my surprise) by peers for having a knack for research, Iâ€™m happiest when Iâ€™ve thrown myself into a brand-new scientific rabbit holeâ€”somehow managing to learn the latest advances fast enough to come up with fresh ideas before I get completely lost. My real curiosity lies where neuro-symbolic, generative AI, physics-informed machine learning, and heavy mathematical frameworks all meetâ€”basically, the nerdâ€™s Bermuda Triangle. 
        I balance theory with practice: I can wrangle hundreds of lines of code, build sturdy software pipelines, and occasionally forget what day it is while polishing a solution until it actually looks elegant.

In this work, we introduce structural modifications to RNNs that eliminate the dependency on numerical derivatives, allowing for the formation of purely physics-informed loss functions using backpropagation. The archived version of this paper is currently accessible, with the source code set for release upon official publication."
